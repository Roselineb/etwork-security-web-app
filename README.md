Detection Accuracy: 99%

## Results and Impact
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive modeling in network security has significantly enhanced the ability to detect and mitigate cyber threats before they materialize. Unlike traditional security measures, which often rely on reactive approaches, AI-driven systems analyze historical data, identify patterns, and adapt to new threats in real time. This adaptability is crucial in today’s evolving digital landscape, where cybercriminals continually develop sophisticated attack methods to bypass conventional defenses.One of the key advantages of the proposed system is its ability to analyze large volumes of network traffic data in real-time. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as deep learning, the system can efficiently detect anomalies, intrusions, and potential cyberattacks.
This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
